# EmeraldEngine
A fighting game engine similar to mugen!

I like the mugen engine a lot I have spent some time using it. I enjoyed its customizability and would like to improve upon it. I have plans to make this engine better by adding features that its missing but I am very lazy. So I uploaded it here so everyone can use it and modify it to make it better. I am 15 year old trying to learn programming with c++ and I decided to get right into making an engine. I have some experience not like I am total noob but I am not that good either. So please help me out here if you can. This is a list of things I plan to implement:

* Customizable Combo Sequences
* Interactive Stages(Similar to Guilty Gear, Injustice, Dragon Ball Fighter Z)
* Online Capability(Public Lobbies and such(Might be challenging but there might be a way))
* Customizable story for characters
* Custom Game Modes(Can be made by developers using the engine)
* 3D characters (maybe not too sure on this one)


I will keep updating this list as time goes on if more things come to mind. Some of these might be a bit ambitious but thats why I am posting my project in Github. If anyone would like to help me build this passion project of mine please contact me. The reason I have this project under the license that its on is because I want my engine to be very customizable. Some people may want to change how the character script works or similar things which is why I want them to have access to the files but I also would like for them to distribute the modifications so others can use it as well.
